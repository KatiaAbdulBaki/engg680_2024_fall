Course Project -
Land Cover Mapping Using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Study Area: Central Texas
Objectives: To apply a SVM classifier within the Earth Engine framework to classify land cover from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The study aims to: 
	- Implement and validate a SVM classifier for land cover 	  classification. 
	- Analyze the effectiveness of different spectral bands in 	  improving classification accuracy.
	- Assess the potential of Earth Engine as a tool for 	 	  environmental monitoring and land cover analysis.
