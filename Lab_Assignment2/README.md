This assignment is about understanding the fundamental principles of Least Square Estimation and program Non-Linear LSE problems using Python. 
For this assignment, we want to develop a system to track self-driving vehicles in term of their positions. To do so, we are task to build a plan to build an algorithm of Single Point Positioning (SPP) using measurements from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and by applying LSE to get to the solution.
